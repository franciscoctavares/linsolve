# linsolve
Cli tool for solving linear programming models, made in c++

## Currently working on
### Branch and Bound
* currently it explores all nodes, until a whole solution is found, or the node's problem is infeasible or unbounded
* will add fathoming to optimize the execution of the solver, as well as exploration and branching strategies
