# linsolve
Cli tool for solving linear programming models

## Features
* Simplex method for LP problems
* Branch and Bound method for pure IP problems
    * Exploration strategies:
        * EXPLORE_ALL_NODES
        * BEST_OBJECTIVE_FUNCTION_VALUE
    * Fathoming of nodes with continuous solutions worse than current incumbent solution

## Currently working on
* Performance metrics for IP problem resolution
* Displaying the performance metrics after solving the IP model

## Coming soon
* 3 new Exploration strategies: RANDOM, WIDTH and DEPTH
